		In 2009, IIM Shillong collaborated with the Shillong Golf Club to host a golf tournament for corporate heads, budding golfers and students alike. Since then, every year, IIM Shillong hosts its flagship event, the Golf Cup at the Shillong Golf course. The annual golfing event of the college is currently in its tenth edition. The venue, Shillong Golf Course known as the 'Gleneagles of the East', is the only natural golf course in the whole of Asia.		</p>
		<p  style="text-align:justify">
		The annual tourney sees participation from over 150 pioneering golfers, cutting across government, industry and academia. The tournament, first of its kind for any business school in India, is a unique and well-woven event that facilitates industry- academia participation and encourages professionals to "Look East". It is held with an aim to connect top corporate professionals with the management academia in a leisurely setting while celebrating the spirit of Golf and Sport.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		The Golf Cup, sees keen involvement from state government ministers from across the North East, with the first day of the tournament dedicated to the local golfers and government officials. The second day sees the leading figures of the industry competing against each other and displaying exemplary sportsmanship.

        <h6 class="col-9">
		<p  style="text-align:justify">
		The IIM Shillong Golf Cup offers a one of its kind experience and blends together a golf tournament, corporate discussions, knowledge workshops and networking dinners where corporate leaders, academicians, bureaucrats and other thought leaders come together to deliberate happenings across the business world.		</p>
		<p  style="text-align:justify">
		IIM Shillong Golf Cup is an invitation tournament and an integral aspect of the Institute's Student Annual Fest which is essentially managed under the ambit of the Student Affairs Dept. and a special Committee formed to oversee operations. The Annual IIM Shillong Golf Cup may also be seen as a platform that provides participants of IIM S with hands on experience in running operations towards successful conduct and completion. The Institute enables active participation of the student community through leadership of the Student Council.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		Every year the event hosts various dignitaries, corporate stalwarts, bureaucrats, policy makers, and students from across B-schools who come together at one of Asia's largest natural, and wettest golf courses, the Gleneagles of the East, Shillong.		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		IIM Shillong is the first and only B-School to host a golf tournament with a focussed aim of bringing together leaders from various business domains to share knowledge with budding managers on the golfing greens. The belief that more alliances have been forged on the golf course than in the boardroom, gave rise to the idea of conducting a high-profile golf tournament as a common platform to associate.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		More importantly, the golf cup provides an avenue for the Institute to play a facilitating role in bridging gaps that can directly and indirectly impact growth and development within the North Eastern Region of the country as a whole, by hosting talks on business opportunities between corporate influencers and key government officials.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		Earlier editions have seen participation of corporate golfers from Goldman Sachs, E&Y, HP, VMWare, PWC, KPMG, McKinsey India, Apeejay Group, Goodricke Group Ltd, ONGC, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Vodafone and many more.

		The rolling mountains, the distant horizon, the clear blue sky, the solitude, the utter tranquillity, the peacefulness - craft the beautiful city of Shillong to be popularly branded as 'Scotland of the East'. In a place like that, in between the hills, the students of IIM Shillong are preparing to organise yet another exhilarating Golf Cup, Season 11.		<p  style="text-align:justify">

		The lights in the basketball court show the die-hards still fighting for the ball, it is quite amazing, A pool of darkness... a nip in the air... floodlit courts... strains of music and laughter from the quad... calls of night-birds... double strong coffee... Volleyball at night in the quadrangle...		
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		Welcome to the magical, mystical place called IIM Shillong (HELL-LONG).		
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		There is a party in the process in the quad... moonlight, music and the other good things in life by the hills. The Organizers and the players meet at the Night Canteen discussing the details of the upcoming Golf Cup... they place last-minute orders at the Night Canteen - where even the quintessential "two-minute" Maggi Noodles takes half an hour to prepare - IIMS Standard Time, you see! (But believe me - the momos are pretty good!). And even if none of these pastimes holds your interest... there is always a movie youâ€™d love to watch available on the network. Walking past the Scholar's Path, one will hear strange guttural chants coming from within its confines, which rise to an eerie crescendo... but fear not... as it is one of the entries to the famous Quadrangle of IIM Shillong, it's just a preparation for what is lying ahead.		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		In the daytime, there are classes, quizzes, project submissions - the mundane necessities of academic life. Though these aren't that bad, really, for things as boring as Macro-Eco. and Stats. are made quite interesting by the eminent faculty we are fortunate to have. And what shall we do of evenings... why, there are Momos to be gulped down, there is the Dorema by the Campus gates, there are PPTs to attend where you shall be fed delectable "High tea"...there are extra classes and tutorials to bear, Quizzes to mug for.		
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		We shall attend classes... (the views from the Lecture Hall are amazing ). We shall frequent Xerox once a week to gather notes and assignment solutions courtesy the generous brains that have solved them for our sake. Since we have exams once every 6 weeks we don't get much time to slack off! And we shall work get a good GPA, bag a placement, put "nights out", submit Projects, play hard, study harder... and party hardest!		
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		For it really is true when they say... your time at IIM Shillong is the "best daze of your life"!
